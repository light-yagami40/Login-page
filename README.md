# Login-page
My first project using HTML and CSS

**A SINGLE PAGE LOGIN FORM**

The green color seems to flow through the gap between the boxes. It gives the webpage an asthetic look when there is no action outside the input form.

And the color of the box changes to green as long as the cursor over it. When the cursor is no longer on the box, its color gradually changes back to its original color which in this casse is black. This creates a wake like pattern when the cursor hovers over multiple boxes in a short period of time. You can play with it to kill some time or while the server loads into another page. Hahaha.

Thank you for taking time to read this.
